# BinGO – Smart Waste Management  

## Overview  
BinGO is a **practical, scalable waste management system** designed to keep cities cleaner by combining **community-driven reporting, sensor-based detection, and AI-powered scheduling**.  

Traditional waste collection follows rigid schedules, leading to **wasted resources and overflowing bins**. BinGO optimizes waste collection by ensuring **timely pickups where they are actually needed**, reducing inefficiencies and improving urban sanitation.  

## Tech Stack

### Frontend  
- **React.js** – for building interactive user interfaces  
- **Tailwind CSS** – for utility-first, responsive styling  

### Backend  
- **Node.js** – for server-side logic  
- **Express.js** – for handling HTTP requests and routing  
- **MongoDB** – for efficient and scalable data storage  

### Additional Technologies  
- **Machine Learning** – for optimized scheduling and predictive analytics  
- **Sensors Integration** – for real-time bin status updates  
- **OpenStreetMap API** – for location mapping and geospatial visualization  

## Features  
### 1. **User Reporting System**  
   - Residents can **report overflowing waste bins** by submitting a photo.  
   - Reports are verified and automatically **added to waste collectors' routes**.  

### 2. **Sensor-Based Detection**  
   - Smart sensors monitor bin levels and trigger **automatic pickup requests** when bins are full.  
   - This ensures collection is based on actual waste levels, reducing unnecessary trips.  

### 3. **Admin Panel**  
   - Admins can **view reports, monitor sensor data, and manage collection routes**.  
   - A **visual dashboard** provides insights into waste conditions across the city.  

### 4. **ML-Based Scheduling**  
   - Predicts **optimal waste collection schedules** based on historical data.  
   - Helps in planning waste pickup for areas without active reports or sensor data.  

### 5. **Nearest Bin Locator**  
   - A feature that helps users **find the closest available waste bin**, reducing littering.  

## Installation & Setup  
### 1. Clone the Repository  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/sayalee16/Waste-Management.git  
cd Waste-Management  
```

### 2. Backend Setup  
```sh
cd server  
npm install  
npm start  
```

### 3. Frontend Setup  
```sh
cd client  
npm install  
npm start  
```

## Usage  
1. **Users report** overflowing bins with photos.  
2. **Sensors detect** waste levels and trigger pickups.  
3. **Admins monitor and optimize** collection routes using a dashboard.  
4. **ML-based scheduling** predicts optimal pickup timings.  
5. **Nearest bin locator** helps citizens dispose of waste properly.  

## What Makes BinGO Unique?  
- **Community-powered reporting** ensures bins without sensors are still monitored.  
- **Smart sensors** detect waste levels in real-time, reducing unnecessary collection trips.  
- **Machine learning** optimizes scheduling for efficient waste management.  
- **A hybrid approach** bridges the gap between manual reports and automated detection.
